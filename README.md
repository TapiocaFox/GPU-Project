For Three Experiment

1. Static Analysis Model - using microbenchmark:
   
   1. First do microbenchmark on different GPUs. Please follow readme.md in src/microbenchmarking/readme.md
   2. Static Analysis Model Time Prediction. Please follow readme.md in src/static_analysis_model/readme.md

3. LLM Zero Shot:

   Template generated in Section 1 is in src/LLM/Data/ChatGPT/cuda_kernel_prediction_template.txt
   
4. LLM Few Shot: The data and code is in few shot directory
